# C#/RESTFul API Challenge
√çlia Digital C#/RESTFul API Challenge.

Hey, what's up? Are you ready to start the challenge? We would like to remember that this step will help us evaluate your performance. Take a deep breath and let‚Äôs go! We‚Äôre rooting for you. üòÅ

## Some rules
  1.	DO NOT share your answer with others;
  2.	Remember that this challenge is meant to evaluate your skills, you don't necessarily have to finish all the challenge code implementation, we just want to get to know you better. üòÅ

# Steps
* Fork the repository;
* Create a branch (from master branch) with the following pattern: Use your name as branch name, eg: Considering that my name is Jose da Silva the branch name should be: "feature/jose_silva";
* Work only on your branch, and after you finish, create a Pull Request targeting "master" branch on this repository;
*	DO NOT change the reviewers of your Pull Request.

# Requirements
*	.NET Core 3.1 or above.

# Instructions
For the purposes of this challenge, we recommend using Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code. You must create your solution from scratch.
After setting it all up, let's go to the challenge!!! \o/

# Challenge
Considerer a basic RESTFul API application used for recording customer data that follows the given requirements:
* It must be developed using C# with .NET Core 3.1+ framework;
* The customer data to be used as input must obey the following properties:
  * Name;
  * E-mail;
  * Phone contact;
  * Address - it must be structured with, at least, the following components:
    * Street;
    * Number;
    * Zipcode;
    * City;
    * State;
    * Countr.
*	The customer‚Äôs data must be provided, and registered, by the user, via the Web API routes;
*	The existing data must be accessible in 02 different manners:
    *	As a list;	  
    *	As a detailed object for a single entry.
*	Users must be able to:
    *	Create an entry;
    *	Edit an entry;
    * Delete an entry.
* Some suggestions and guidelines for the development of your solution:
    * Pay attention to the used syntax when naming routes and methods;
    *	We suggest a DDD architecture, but feel free to design your solution as you see fit;
    *	While developing your application, bear in mind 03 things:
          * Keep the code as clean as possible;
          * In the IT World, collaboration means everything. Therefore, keep your code as maintainable as possible;
          *	Documenting is a good code-development practice;
  *	Testing is one of the gateways for a consistent, scalable, and robust solution: feel free to implement testing as you would in the real world;
  *	As we have previously mentioned, you do not need to solve this challenged in its entirety, but we will surely consider your best effort;
  * There‚Äôs some tools that can help your development, as using Entity Framework with MSSQL or a MySQL database.

Happy coding!
